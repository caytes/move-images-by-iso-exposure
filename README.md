# move-images-by-iso-exposure
This script is still in development.

A Python script for my astrophotography images that locates and moves images to another folder using the specified ISO and Exposure values. I can take between 20 - 300 photographs of the night sky using different settings. So, I decided to create this script to extract only those files that I need for further processing.
